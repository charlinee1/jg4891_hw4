# Introduction
My name is Charline Gu. I'm a second year MPH student in HPM department at Columbia
University. I'm interested in health policy.

## Quantitative Skills
I have a lot of experiences with R, Stata, and SAS. I'm also a research assistant 
working on different projects for five years. You can check my experiences [here](resume.html).

## Interests
A little bit more about me... I have 8 animals at home, but my favoite one is my dog.
I like horror movies and horror games. My favorite ones 
are *[Insidious](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/insidious/umc.cmc.3baqa4v7kn2pg6ttw7hkxkpx)
